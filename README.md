# Dojo-Blog
- A basic react blog app (Credit: The Net Ninja).
- This is a simple and minimalistic blog web app created using React.js.
- It lets you create blogs and upload it to a json server.

# How to use it?
- First download the whole project as a zip folder and then unzip it to get the project directory.
- Run 'npm install' in the dojo-blog directory to get the required node modules folder.
- Then run 'npx json-server --watch ./data/db.json --port 8000' to connect to the json server database.
- Without killing the above operation, run 'npm start' in a simultaneous terminal to open the react app on to the browser.
- Then you are good to go.

# Note
- If you get error in connecting to the database, try changing the port number.

### Thank you.
